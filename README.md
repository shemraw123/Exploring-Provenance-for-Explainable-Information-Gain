# Overview


# Features

# Usage #

# Installation

The [wiki](https://github.com/IITDBGroup/gprom/wiki/installation) has detailed installation instructions. In a nutshell, GProM can be compiled with support for different database backends and is linked against the C client libraries of these database backends. The installation follows the standard procedure using GNU build tools. Checkout the git repository, install all dependencies and run:

```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

# Research and Background

The functionality of GProM is based on a long term research effort by the [IIT DBGroup](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~dbgroup/) studying how to capture provenance on-demand using instrumentation. Links to [publications](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~dbgroup/publications) and more research oriented descriptions of the techniques implemented in GProM can be found at [http://www.cs.iit.edu/~dbgroup/research](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~dbgroup/research).
